            <p  class="restau-p">A <b>seafood restaurant</b> is a restaurant that specializes in seafood cuisine and seafood dishes, such as fish and shellfish. Dishes may include freshwater fish. The concept may focus upon the preparation and service of fresh seafood, (as opposed to frozen products). Some seafood restaurants also provide retail sales of seafood that consumers take home to prepare. Seafood restaurants may have a marine-themed decor, with decorations such as fish nets, nautical images and buoys. Fare can vary due to seasonality in fish availability and in the fishing industry. Seafood restaurants may offer additional non-seafood items, such as chicken and beef dishes.</p>
            <p class="restau-p"><b>Seafood restaurants</b> have objectives similar to other types of restaurants. But they may face certain challenges because not everyone likes fish or seafood. All seafood restaurants, including fast food, casual and fine dining establishments, aim to meet the needs and wants of consumers. They advertise and distribute coupons to build their businesses. They also reinvest profits to create additional product lines. There are also several other crucial goals for seafood restaurants.</p>

                    <p class="meals-desc-p">Tuna tartare is a dish that combines raw Tuna with a sauce. The Tuna is chopped into small pieces and then mixed with the sauce. This dish can be eaten as an appetizer or as a main course. Tuna Tartare is traditional to Japanese cuisine but has become popular in Western cuisine as well.</p>

                    <p class="meals-desc-p">So our beautiful breaded scampi is a British dish with a history going back to the 1700s and an Italian inspired name. Like many British favourites it is a mash up of British tradition and European flair that really, as a nation, we invented and made our own.</p>

                    <p class="meals-desc-p">A lobster roll is a dish native to New England. It is made of lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog-style bun. The filling may also contain butter, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper, with variants made in some parts of New England replacing the butter with mayonnaise. Other versions may contain diced celery or scallion.</p>

                    <p class="meals-desc-p">Scallops are briny, slightly sweet and buttery with a tender texture. They taste like they come from the sea without being fishy. This shell fish takes on the seasoning that you cook them with so be prepared for a tasty dinner. In other words, scallops are succulent and delicious!</p>

                    <p class="meals-desc-p">The word surf is a fanciful way of referring to the ocean or sea, where seafood comes from, and the word turf refers to grass or land—where cows graze. Surf and turf is basically a shorter and more fun way of saying meat and seafood together in a single dish.</p>
